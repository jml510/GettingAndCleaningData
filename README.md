The instructions for this course project was to demonstrate our ability to clean, organize, and tidy a raw dataset. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
In order to complete this project, we had to: 

    1. Clean and tidy up the data set provided. 
    2. Upload that script to GitHub, along with
        a. A CodeBook that talks about changes made to the data as well as explanations to the variables and other things. 
        b. This README file that explains the script work and how they all connect. 
        
There are four files included in this repository pertaining to this project. 

    1. The ```run_analysis.R``` script, that merges the two datasets together, extracts only the measurements on the
    mean and standard deviation for each measurement, applies descriptive activity names, labels the dataset with
    descriptive variables names, and creates the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for 
    each activity and each subject.
    2. The ```TidyDataSet.txt``` file, which is the completed and tidy dataset. 
    3. The ```CodeBook.md```, which breaks down the process of creating the script 
    4. This ```README.md``` file, which breaks down the instructions of the project.
